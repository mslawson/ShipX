            %b ShipX services, responsibilities and business practices
            %br
            ShipX connects Shippers and Transportation Service Provider (TSP) by providing pricing for shipments and providing a venue where they can enter into agreements.  ShipX is not a party to any agreement made on the ShipX website.  Once the Shipper chooses a TSP all interaction is between those parties and we have not control over the quality, safety or the legal aspects of the transaction.  We do not prequalify the TSPs which participate on the ShipX site and therefore we donâ€™t take any responsibility for their claims, license, insurance, MAP21 compliance or their overall performance.  Conversely we do not prequalify the Shippers who utilize ShipX and therefore cannot be responsible for their actions.  ShipX is not a broker, TSP or Shipper.

            %b Payments
            %br
            As part of ShipX service we collect and disperse payments for the shipping service provided by the TSP through a third party payments clearing house.  The clearing house collects the full amount of the shipping charge including the booking fee at the time of booking and places it in an escrow account.  The escrowed funds due are released to the TSP and ShipX when the shipment is picked up by the TSP.  Any additional charges incurred in the execution of the shipment such as reclassification of the shipment or unbilled accessorials will be billed directly by TSP to the Shipper.  Any disputes will lie solely between the Shipper and the TSP and do not involve ShipX.

            %b Bill of Lading
            %br
            ShipX generates a Bill of Lading for each shipment utilizing information collected from the Shipper and the TSP.  This document is provided as a service only and is deemed to have been prepared by the Shipper.  The parties agree that ShipX does not issue the Bill of Lading and is not a party to it.

            %b Pricing and extra charges
            %br
            All prices are independently set by the TSPs and ShipX has no control over them.  Quoted prices are locked in when the shipment is booked. TSPs are required to provide all-inclusive prices based on the information the shipper provides.  If the actual shipment varies from what was originally specified by the Shipper in size, weight, or freight classification or if accessorial services are required to execute the shipment, the TSP will directly charge the Shipper additional fees. Any disputes over such matters will be solely between the Shipper and the TSP, and will not involve ShipX.  IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT THE SHIPMENT BE PROPERLY CLASSED AND PICKUP/DELIVERY CONDITIONS ARE SPECIFIED SO EXTRA CHARGES CAN BE AVOIDED.

            %b Cancellations
            %br
            %b If the shipper cancels the shipment more than 24 hours prior to scheduled pickup all funds will be refunded to the Shipper.  If shipment is cancelled within 24 hours of scheduled pickup, ShipX will refund all fees minus ShipX booking fee and $50.00 cancellation fee to the TSP.  If the TSP cancels the shipment at any time, all funds will be refunded to the Shipper.

            %b Insurance
            %br
            ShipX may offer cargo insurance coverage for your shipment.  ShipX is not an insurance broker or insurer and any insurance purchased is solely between Shipper and the Insurance Company.  ShipX may collect an advertising fee from the Insurance company but is not a party to the agreement between Insurer and Shipper.

            %b Shipper responsibilities
            %br
            The Shipper is responsible for reading and understanding all terms, conditions and fees published by the TSPs.  By booking your freight with a TSP a Shipper is agreeing to the TSPs terms, conditions, fees and business practices. The shipper acknowledges that pickup dates, delivery dates and transit times are estimates only.  Additionally Shipper is responsible for properly specifying the freight, pickup and destination or be subject to additional fees charged by the TSP.  Since ShipX does not screen TSPs for their compliance to federal, state and local regulations or MAP21 compliance the Shipper should confirm compliance with the TSP prior to shipment.

            %b Transportation Service Provider responsibilities
            %br
            Transportation Service Providers (TSP) include Carriers, Brokers and Third Party Logistics companies.  A TSP must legally be able to transport shipments and comply with all local, state and federal laws and licensing requirements.  The rates provided by a TSP through ShipX are solely provided by the TSP and are binding to the shipper for the freight and lane the Shipper has defined.  Furthermore, any booked shipment with the TSP is a legally binding obligation of the TSP. ShipX has no control of the accuracy of the shipment information.  If the freight classification or other information not does not accurately describe the freight, the TSP will turn to the Shipper, not ShipX for any extra charges.
